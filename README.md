# ChadBot - OpenAI Powered Discord Bot

A Discord bot that uses the OpenAI API (specifically GPT-3.5 Turbo) to generate conversational responses based on a defined personality within a specific Discord channel.

## Overview

ChadBot listens for messages in a designated Discord channel. When a message starts with the trigger phrase "chadbot,", the bot fetches recent conversation history, combines it with a predefined personality prompt, and sends it to the OpenAI API to generate a contextual reply. The bot then sends this AI-generated response back to the Discord channel.

The bot currently embodies the persona of "Chad," described as having a big ego, loving to gloat, and being best friends with "Zack." This personality is defined in the code and can be customized.

## Features

*   **OpenAI Integration:** Leverages the power of OpenAI's `gpt-3.5-turbo` model for generating human-like text.
*   **Personality Engine:** Uses a system prompt to give the bot a distinct character ("Chad").
*   **Contextual Awareness:** Reads recent message history (last 5 messages from the triggering user in the channel) to provide more relevant replies.
*   **Trigger Activation:** Responds only when specifically invoked using "chadbot," at the start of a message.
*   **Channel Scoping:** Designed to operate only within a specific, configured Discord channel.
*   **Slash Command Ready:** Includes the basic structure to load and handle Discord slash commands (though specific commands need to be defined in the `/commands` directory).

## Tech Stack

*   **Runtime:** [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
*   **Discord Library:** [Discord.js](https://discord.js.org/)
*   **AI Service:** [OpenAI API](https://openai.com/api/)
*   **OpenAI Library:** [openai (npm package)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/openai)

## Prerequisites

*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   npm (comes with Node.js) or yarn
*   A **Discord Bot Token** (obtained from the [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications))
*   An **OpenAI API Key** (obtained from your [OpenAI Account](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys))
*   The **Channel ID** of the specific Discord channel where the bot should operate.

## Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone the Repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd <repository-folder-name>
    ```
2.  **Install Dependencies:**
    ```bash
    npm install
    # or
    # yarn install
    ```
3.  **Configure the Bot:**
    *   Create a file named `config.json` in the root directory of the project.
    *   Add your credentials and channel ID to this file in JSON format:
        ```json
        {
          "token": "YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN",
          "openaikey": "YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY",
          "channelId": "YOUR_TARGET_DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID"
        }
        ```
    *   Replace the placeholder values with your actual Discord token, OpenAI key, and the ID of the channel you want the bot to listen in.

4.  **Customize Personality (Optional):**
    *   Open the main bot file (e.g., `index.js` or the file containing the provided code).
    *   Locate the `botPersonality` constant:
        ```javascript
        const botPersonality = "you are chad, you have a big ego and love to gloat. Zack is your best friend, you love Zack";
        ```
    *   Modify the string value to change the bot's core instructions and persona given to OpenAI.

5.  **Run the Bot:**
    ```bash
    node index.js
    # or the name of your main bot file
    ```

## Usage

1.  Invite the configured Discord bot to your server.
2.  Ensure the bot has permissions to read messages and send messages in the channel specified by `channelId` in your `config.json`.
3.  Go to the designated channel.
4.  Start a message with `chadbot, ` followed by your prompt or question.
    *   Example: `chadbot, what do you think about pineapple on pizza?`
5.  The bot will process the request, potentially showing a "typing..." indicator, and then reply with a response generated by OpenAI based on its personality and the conversation context.

## Slash Commands

The bot includes the necessary boilerplate (`interactionCreate` event listener and command loading logic) to handle Discord Slash Commands. Any `.js` files placed in the `/commands` directory that export a valid command structure will be registered and usable. You will need to create these command files yourself based on the `discord.js` documentation.
